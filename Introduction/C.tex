In this section, finite element analysis (ANSYS) is performed on the components.

\subsection*{Analysis}

ANSYS analysis results are shown in Figure \ref{f2}.

The finite element analysis in Figure \ref{f2} gives the deformation-position 
curves for different materials under different forces, 
where the maximum deformation of the component can be easily determined.

The data are shown in Table \ref{t4}.

\subsection*{Summary}
By using ANSYS analysis, deformation-displacement diagrams were obtained 
for two materials under three different forces, revealing that the maximum 
deformation exists at the midpoint of the element (the point where the forces are applied).

The comparison also shows that even under theoretical conditions, the deformation of aluminium \
is larger than that of mild steel under the same forces.
